Problem statement: 
Anyone who has booked a flight ticket knows how
unexpectedly the prices vary. The cheapest available ticket on a
given flight gets more and less expensive over time.  Airlines implement dynamic pricing for their tickets and base
their pricing decisions on demand estimation models. The
reason for such a complicated system is that each flight only
has a set number of seats to sell, so airlines have to regulate
demand.
