# Problem statement

</p>

Anyone who has booked a flight ticket knows how
unexpectedly the prices vary. The cheapest available ticket on a
given flight gets more and less expensive over time.  Airlines implement dynamic pricing for their tickets and base
their pricing decisions on demand estimation models. The
reason for such a complicated system is that each flight only
has a set number of seats to sell, so airlines have to regulate
demand. 

# Objective of this project
-  To study the factors which influence the fluctuations in the
airfare prices and how they are related to the change in the
prices. 

- The observations made in this paper will help the buyersto plan
their journey in a smart and cost-effecient manner. The
passengers will know when to travel, which airline to travel with
and what part of the day to travel so as to make it a pocket
friendly booking.

# Dataset
I have extracted the data from [Aertrip](https://aertrip.com/v2/flights) using ***Selenium***. 

The dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhambathwal/flight-price-prediction?select=Clean_Dataset.csv).

# Techstack Used
- ***Selenium*** for web scraping. 

- ***Numpy***, ***Pandas*** for data pre-processing/manipulation.

- ***Matplot***, ***Seaborn*** for data visualization.

- ***Sklearn*** for ML model library.
